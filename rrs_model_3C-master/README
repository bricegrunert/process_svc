1) Dependencies
python(>=3.4.3)
numpy(>=1.12.0)
pandas(>=0.19.2)
theano(>=0.8.2)
lmfit(>=0.9.5)
matplotlib(>=1.5.1)
seaborn(>=0.7.1), optional

2) Usage

-- Environment --
The model is written in python, and can be called either directly from a command line:

    python3 rrs_model_3C.py

or and ipython3 console:
    
    run rrs_model_3C.py

or perused in user scripts by amending the following import statement to the script header:
    
    from rrs_model_3C import rrs_model_3C


-- Initialisation --
The model can be instantiated with a user-defined spectral range by setting the 'wl_range' parameter to start and end wavelength. The usable spectral range and resolution is constrained by the model input spectra shipped with the package (specific absorption of phytoplankton astar_ph, specific absorption of CDOM astar_y, water absorption a_w). These spectra can be replaced by the user's if deemed necessary, by adjusting 'spectra_path' accordingly. The parameter 'downsampling' allows to adjust model spectral resolution to that of measurements. A moving window filter (boxcar) of width as indicated by 'downsampling' is applied to all input spectra listed above. This is skipped if 'downsampling' is set to 'False'. 


-- Fit preparation --
All model parameters are aggregated in a lmfit parameter array ('params'), which contains six fields per parameter: 

    Parameter name (string)
    Optimization starting value (float)
    Parameter variable in optimization (bool)
    Lower bound (float)
    Upper bound (float)
    Logical expression (string)

This array defaults to values as listed in Groetsch et. al. (2017). CDOM slope parameter 'S_y' can be set to -1 to make use of a measured CDOM specific absorption spectrum (to be stored as rrs_model_3C.astar_y), instead of the built-in exponential model. Spectral weights are assigned in the pandas series 'weights'. 


-- Fit --
A 3C model fit requires the following measurements. 

    wl: wavelength array (numpy array)
    Ls: sky radiance (numpy array)
    Lu: upwelling radiance (numpy array)
    Ed: downwelling irradiance (numpy array)

An example data set is included. The method 'fit_LuEd()' is invoked automatically when rrs_model_3C.py is called directly, and returns the following parameters:

    reg: lmfit minimizer result set
    Rrs_modelled: modelled remote sensing reflectance (numpy array)
    Rrs_refl: surface-reflected reflectance (numpy array)
    Lu_Ed_modelled: modelled Lu/Ed spectrum (numpy array)
    Rrs_obs: final derived remote sensing reflectance (numpy array)
